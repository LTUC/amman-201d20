        <p>
          We offer five intensive training courses that vary in terms of
          duration and competency level. With our curriculum – presented by
          Seattle-based <a href="codefellows.org">Code Fellows</a> – you will learn a new skill every day and
          be part of an integrated team, completing practical projects and
          graduating with a skillset that qualifies you to obtain work
          immediately with some of the largest tech companies in Jordan and
          around the world. Throughout your journey with us, which may last up
          to six months, you will meet specialists within the field of software
          development, as well as Code Fellows instructors from Seattle – all of
          whom will help you progress into a professional software developer and
          earn a globally-accredited certificate. Are you an undergraduate? Do
          you hold a degree in Engineering, IT or any other related
          specialization? Are you a programmer or technician looking to upskill
          to meet the latest labor market requirements? Perhaps you want to
          kick-start an entirely new career that offers better prospects?
          Whatever your motive or programming proficiency, Code Fellows courses
          are the ideal choice for you! Don’t worry about your competency level.
          Before you begin, you will undergo a test that determines the right
          course for you. Learn more about the courses available at each level.
